# What changes were made to refactor the code

I updated the webpage by following the acceptance criteria's listed.
I added alt captions to each image so it is easier for people to know what the image is, if the image is not loading on their computer.
I updated the title of the webpage.
I combined common selectors to shorten lines of code.
I added different semantic tags where they could be needed.
