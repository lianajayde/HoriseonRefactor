# Code Refactor Starter Code
# Challenge One : Horiseon Refactor
The name of this project is Horiseon Refactor and it is my first challenge in bootcamp.


# Webpage description

This website explains the different ways to promote a business, such as being able to control what people 
post about your buisness on social media.
It explains how social media can help improve your business. 

# What changes were made to refactor the code

I updated the webpage by following the acceptance criteria's listed.

I added alt captions to each image so it is easier for people to know what the image is, if the image is not loading on their computer.

I updated the title of the webpage.

I combined common selectors to shorten lines of code.

I added different semantic tags where they could be needed.

I deleted some font family text so that there wasn't a long list of fonts.
